The singer, who has sold more than 80 million records worldwide with hits such as "Hips Don't Lie", earlier this week rejected a settlement offer from the prosecutor's office to close the case. She is accused of failing to pay taxes between 2012 and 2014, a period in which Shakira says she did not live in Spain. The prosecutor's document, seen by Reuters, asserts that Shakira was ordinarily resident in Spain between 2012 and 2014 and in May 2012 bought a house in Barcelona which became a family home for herself, her partner and their son born in Spain in 2013. It asked for an eight-year prison sentence and a fine of more than 23 million euros ($23.5 million) should she be found guilty. No date for a trial has been set yet. Asked to comment, Shakira's representatives referred to a previous statement sent out on Wednesday saying she "is fully confident of her innocence" and that she considers the case "a total violation of her rights". The terms of the earlier settlement offer have not been disclosed. The 45-year-old singer - dubbed the Queen of Latin Pop - said she initially paid the 17.2 million euros that the Spanish tax office said she owed and claims she has no outstanding debt with the tax authorities. The latest development in the tax case comes a month after Shakira and her husband, FC Barcelona defender Gerard Pique, announced they were separating. Shakira, 45, and Pique, 35, have been together since 2011 and have two sons.

   Actor Will Smith   for striking presenter Chris Rock during the live TV broadcast of this year's Academy Awards ceremony. Audiences around the world watched Smith stride onstage after Rock made a crack about Smith's wife's short haircut. Smith slapped Rock in the face, then sat back down in the audience and yelled expletives at him. Smith went on to win the best actor Oscar for his starring role in the film  . But days later, he resigned from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, which then banned him from its events for 10 years. "Chris, I apologize to you. My behavior was unacceptable and I'm here whenever you're ready to talk," Smith said Friday in the emotional video, adding that he had reached out to Rock and was told the comedian is not yet ready. Earlier this week,   during his standup show in New Jersey. "Anyone who says words hurt has never been punched in the face," Rock reportedly joked, adding that he wasn't a victim and shook it off. "I don't go to the hospital for a papercut." Hours after the infamous slap, Smith had written Rock . But this was his first message on video. "There is no part of me that thinks that was the right way to behave in that moment," he said. "There's no part of me that thinks that's the optimal way to handle a feeling of disrespect or insults." Facing the camera, Smith sighed several times and appeared to hold back tears. He addressed questions that have been raised, such as: Why didn't you apologize to Chris in your acceptance speech? "I was fogged out by that point," he answered. Smith has said he responded to Rock's joke about his wife's buzz-cut hair, similar to the style sported by Demi Moore in the movie  . Jada Pinkett Smith suffers hair loss and has publicly addressed her struggle with alopecia. "After Jada rolled her eyes, did she tell you to do something?" was another question Smith answered in the video. "I made a choice on my own, from my own experiences, from my history with Chris," he said. "Jada had nothing to do with it. I'm sorry, babe." Smith also apologized to Rock's mother Rose and brother Tony, once a good friend of his. He also said he was sorry to musician Ahmir "Questlove" Thompson, who   moments after the infamous slap. "It really breaks my heart to have stolen and tarnished your moment," Smith said, addressing Questlove. "And, you know, it's like, 'I'm sorry' really isn't sufficient." Smith said over the last few months, he's gone over the Oscars incident many times, trying to work on himself. He closed the video message by saying he hates having disappointed people. "I know it was confusing, I know it was shocking," Smith said. "But I promise you, I am deeply devoted and committed to putting light and love and joy into the world. And, you know, if you hang on, I promise we'll be able to be friends again." Sponsor Message Monsoonal rain swept through downtown   on Thursday night, pelting casino carpets on the Strip through leaky roofs and rushing through a parking garage that looked more like a white-water rapids course.

Instead of seeping into the desert terrain, storm water tends to accumulate in Las Vegas, meaning relatively little precipitation can lead to flooding. The monsoon-triggered storms prompted the National Weather Service to issue both severe thunderstorm and flash flood warnings Thursday night. Radar showed a narrow but intense corridor of storms that swept into Vegas around 8:30 p.m. local time  Harry Reid International Airport received 0.32 inches of rain — around its average amount for the entire month of July — while “a couple pockets of town picked up over an inch,” the Weather Service wrote.

President   appeared in public twice Thursday, and both times he delivered the same carefully crafted remarks, contending that current low unemployment rates, coupled with new investments in manufacturing, make it impossible for the economy to be in a recession. "Let me just give you what the facts are in terms of the state of the economy," Biden said in a speech that was billed as remarks on the latest budget bill in Congress. "Number one, we have a record job market, and record unemployment of 3.6%, and businesses are investing in America at record rates." He then listed several companies planning to build factories in the U.S. before concluding, "that doesn't sound like a recession to me." Outside the White House bubble, however, the latest GDP data sounded a lot like a recession. On Thursday, the Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic Analysis reported that gross domestic product, the broadest measure of economic activity,&nbsp; . Coming on the heels of a 1.6% contraction in the first quarter, the two straight declines meet&nbsp; . The official arbiter of recessions, the National Bureau of Economic Research, likely won't rule for months. Later in the day, Biden held a roundtable event with five chief executives of major companies, also aimed at showcasing the strength of the American economy. The leaders of Corning,  ,  , TIAA and Deloitte were all present, with Marriott's Tony Capuano and Corning's Wendell Weeks attending in person. "There's gonna be a lot of chatter today on Wall Street and among pundits about whether we are in a recession," Biden said in his opening remarks. "But if you look at our job market, consumer spending, business investment, we see signs of economic progress in the second quarter, as well." Biden also quoted   Chairman  , who said Wednesday that he did not believe the economy was currently in a recession because "there are too many areas of economic growth where the economy is performing too well." What Biden did not mention was that Powell was speaking moments after the Fed announced a second 0.75 percentage point rate hike in as many months, the first time in the modern history of the central bank that it has had two rate increases of three-quarters of a point back to back. Biden was not the only major figure who went before the cameras Thursday to contend that what the U.S. economy is experiencing is not, in fact, a recession. Treasury Secretary   held a rare, stand-alone news conference at the Treasury in between the president's two events. Read more of CNBC's politics coverage: Yellen insisted that a recession is a "broad-based weakening of our economy" that includes substantial layoffs, business closures and strains in household finances. "That is not what we are seeing right now," she said. "When you look at the economy, job creation is continuing, household finances remain strong, consumers are spending and businesses are growing." Several other White House officials went on cable news shows to make similar arguments, including National Economic Council Director Brian Deese. Appearing Thursday on CNBC's " " Deese said that although the post-pandemic economic boom was slowing, this did not amount to a recession. "I think if you look at the&nbsp;full data and the type of data&nbsp;that NBER looks at, virtually&nbsp;nothing signals that this period&nbsp;in the second quarter is&nbsp;recessionary," he said, referring to the National Bureau of Economic Research. But what individuals believe to be true about the economy could prove to be a more powerful economic indicator than what is actually true. In the past few months, consumer and business confidence levels have plunged. And   show that a solid majority of Americans believe the country is in a recession. This is in large part because soaring inflation has cut deep into the buying power of the average American worker's paycheck,&nbsp; , and economic growth has failed to keep up. People who are worried about a recession are likely to rein in their household spending and delay major purchases, which in turn can have its own negative ripple effect throughout the economy. With Democrats already facing headwinds in this November's midterm elections, swaying individual voters' opinions about the state of the economy is critically important for Biden and his party to do right now if they hope to maintain control of at least one chamber of Congress. But with just 13 weeks between now and the November elections, it may already be too late. —    Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

Data also provided by   's long-awaited and highly anticipated seventh studio album,  , is now available for the world to hear. The 16-song LP marks her first solo album in 6 years, following the pivotal visual album Critics,  , have said of previews that   signifies a musical evolution for the global superstar.
  includes guest features from  ,   and  , as well as a variety of credits from heavy hitters in the music industry, including several from The-Dream, a collaborator on the megahit "Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)" and producer Mike Dean, and features from Drake and Raphael Saadiq.
 On her website, Beyoncé wrote of  , "This three act project was recorded over three years during the pandemic. A time to be still but also a time I found to be the most creative," an indication that the new release is the first of three parts.
 Last month, she surprise dropped a single from the record, "BREAK MY SOUL," an energetic track rooted in dance music influences, featuring Big Freedia and sampling the 1990 diva house hit "Show Me Love" by Robin S.
 "Thank you to all of the pioneers who originate culture, to all of the fallen angels whose contributions have gone unrecognized far too long," the statement on her website continues.
 In typical Bey fashion, not too many details about the album were disclosed more than a week ahead of its release. She took to social media to update the world on the project, including its official announcement, which came after removing profile pictures across her social media pages.
 I clicked the link to the leak and the first song on the Beyonce album is just her saying "So, you just couldn't wait, could you?" And then she read my address back to me before the song started. I'll see y'all in prison Despite a proven ability to give the world exactly what Beyoncé wants when Beyoncé wants to, no more and no less, the new album was leaked online just two days before its release; some fans alleged that they'd seen the CD for sale early in media stores in France and the Netherlands.
 She addressed the leak, and the backlash from patient fans it received on social media, in a post just ahead of the album's actual release,  : "I appreciate you for calling out anyone that was trying to sneak into the club early ... we are going to take our time and enjoy the music." To that end, and the album is initially being released without videos, in contrast to the visual-heavy releases of   in 2016 and the self-titled album in 2013.
 "My intention was to create a safe place, a place without judgment," Beyoncé's   on her website reads. "A place to be free of perfectionism and overthinking. A place to scream, release, feel freedom. It was a beautiful journey of exploration. I hope you find joy in this music. I hope it inspires you to release the wiggle. Ha! And to feel as unique, strong, and sexy as you are."

 In this article Shares of   jumped more than 12% on Friday, a day after the company   stronger-than-expected second-quarter revenue and gave upbeat guidance. Sales for the three months ended in June grew 7% to $121.23 billion, which was higher than Wall Street's expected $119.09 billion. It represented Amazon's third straight quarter of single-digit annual revenue growth. Amazon's third-quarter forecast suggested sales growth could reaccelerate, to between 13% and 17%. The company said it projects revenue this quarter of $125 billion to $130 billion, while analysts were expecting a sales forecast of $126.4 billion, according to Refinitiv. Amazon and   reported upbeat results in an otherwise gloomy earnings season for tech companies. Facebook parent  ,   and   all announced disappointing results for the quarter, as decades-high inflation, rising interest rates and other macroeconomic pressures weighed on their businesses. Wall Street cheered Amazon's earnings report, with one analyst   the e-commerce giant "a port in the macro storm," as it so far appears to be weathering many of the headwinds challenging its tech peers. "All in, Amazon provided investors with a very clean 2Q earnings, in the midst of extreme macro-related earnings volatility across tech," Deutsche Bank analysts led by Lee Horowitz wrote in a note to clients Friday. The firm, which maintains a buy rating on Amazon shares, upped its price target to $175 from $155. Several analysts said the results signaled Amazon is making progress on cost headwinds that have pressured the company in recent quarters. Amazon   related to labor, supply chain, energy and transportation, as well as  , among other factors. CEO Andy Jassy said Thursday the company continues to work through "the more controllable costs." "With a successful 2-day Prime Day event in July and mgmt [management] discussing end demand concerns in its core businesses, we see Amazon well positioned to produce a strong revenue growth narrative in 2H'22 [the second half of 2022]," analysts at Goldman Sachs, led by Eric Sheridan, said in a research note Friday. The firm kept its buy rating on the shares. Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

The full trailer for the   feature film was released this week and it finally shows de Armas' Monroe in action, recreating some of her iconic looks and quotes. However, the promo has also sparked a debate around de Armas' accent, with many viewers taking to social media to say they can hear her Cuban/Spanish accent coming through. While some have been critical of this element of the movie, others are in favor of it and are praising de Armas' portrayal of the sexual and cultural icon. Fashion watchdog     asked its followers: "Had to do a double (and triple) take at some of these clips from the new 'Blonde' trailer... like is that really Ana de Armas? Also, what do the haters who said her Cuban accent would be an issue have to say now?" To which, one response from Instagram user Jessie Gurunathan reads: "You can still totally hear an accent but who cares. She is going to be amazing in this. Such a god actress and boy does she look and behave like her." While another added: "I love that we are normalizing having actors from different backgrounds and cultures playing these roles. Everyone loved Marylin, all around the world. Why would we expect only American women to want to play her? She was an icon to all." Meanwhile, on  , one person posted: "They rly made that whole ass Marilyn Monroe movie and didn't hire Ana De Armas an accent coach."  "it looks good with no sound on. but ana de armas accent comes through so much for me it's off putting. a bit disappointed as it looks good besides that." it looks good with no sound on. but ana de armas accent comes through so much for me it’s off putting. a bit disappointed as it looks good besides that.  : "everyone seems fixated on ana de armas' accent in BLONDE but i think that only makes the film more interesting; it emphasizes the inherent artifice in biopics (and in acting overall), which imo is appropriate in a work seemingly dedicated to exploring artifice versus reality." everyone seems fixated on ana de armas’ accent in BLONDE but i think that only makes the film more interesting; it emphasizes the inherent artifice in biopics (and in acting overall), which imo is appropriate in a work seemingly dedicated to exploring artifice versus reality The movie has now been given a release date of Friday, September 28, 2022. This comes after nearly a decade of the project being stuck in development hell. Ana de Armas leads a cast that also includes Adrian Brody, Bobby Canavale and Julianne Nicholson. Previously actors such as Jessica Chastain and Naomi Watts were among those formerly attached to play the movie icon.  is based on the novel of the same name by Joyce Carol Oates and de Armas revealed earlier this year that she studied the book in preparation. "I read Joyce's novel, studied hundreds of photographs, videos, audio recordings, films—anything I could get my hands on," de Armas told . "Every scene is inspired by an existing photograph. We'd pore over every detail in the photo and debate what was happening in it," she said. "The first question was always, 'What was Norma Jeane feeling here?' We wanted to tell the human side of her story." The official Netflix synopsis for   reads: "Based on the bestselling novel by Joyce Carol Oates, Blonde boldly reimagines the life of one of Hollywood's most enduring icons,  . From her volatile childhood as Norma Jeane, through her rise to stardom and romantic entanglements,   blurs the lines of fact and fiction to explore the widening split between her public and private selves."

Well … sort of. Where the second episode&nbsp; &nbsp;opens is the front yard of a high-school house party, after which a long continuous shot brings us to a very drunk Imogen, doing shots in the Beasley twins’ kitchen. Freeze-frame, and we get the episode’s first chyron: ABOUT SIX MONTHS&nbsp; GO. And then what do you know, there are the (also very drunk) Beasley twins, laughing and hugging Imogen and generally just being a cool drunk-girl squad. That’s right, it’s a flashback! Specifically, a flashback that Imogen is using to give context to the (very) messy video of a (very) drunk Karen she’s about to suggest the wrongly accused Final Girls use in some public-but-not-internet-permanent way to, well,&nbsp; . Which, I guess, is kind of the same thing as killing her?? “I’m just gonna ask what we’re all thinking,” Faran says with a self-aware eye roll. “Is it a sex video?” That Imogen isn’t just horrified but&nbsp; Faran’s mind would even have gone there is a testament to the core goodness of her character. That she nevertheless keeps brainstorming how to screen this mysteriously damaging video before the Jordan Peele double feature Tabitha convinced her predatory creep of a manager to let her screen at the Orpheum later that night? That’s a testament to the fact that Imogen is also a wounded teenager, and teenagers have a clinically demonstrable weakness in robust critical forethought. Cut to the house where Davie died, where the rest of the Final Girls are huddled in the entryway, peering nervously up the vertiginous stairs as they wait for Imogen to find the phone she stole from the “douchebag” who took the video in the first place. Once they sit down to watch the video in what might be Millwood’s only pizza parlor (which also doubles as Millwood’s favorite pinball joint), Imogen gets cold feet. Sure, Karen may be a world-class jerk, but does she really deserve to have&nbsp; &nbsp;played for the whole school? Unfortunately, now that the other girls have seen the video and had time to marinate in their resentment, there’s no turning back. And considering Karen’s perceived wrongs include&nbsp; , a semi-public screening of one measly video, they reason, is a more than fair trade. Still, Imogen says they should sleep on it. Hilariously, what comes next isn’t the girls getting down to the very serious business of meditating on the morality of counter-bullying but rather a montage of them all returning home to a parent who’s just waiting to pounce about the shocking (alleged) behavior that sent them each to detention. I don’t mean that it’s funny to see them get in trouble, obviously. But the fact that they’re&nbsp; &nbsp;at being confronted at all?? These goofs just went out for pizza and completely forgot that they have “parents” who might be “worried” about them. Incredible! (Although, for anyone who’s on the lookout for any parallels to the OG&nbsp; , this is a pretty good one. Those liars never met a parent whose concern they didn’t immediately discount and/or forget about, either! The more things change …) Unfortunately, that brief shock of parental care is all the time Slasher A needs to scupper Imogen’s “let’s sleep on it” plans. No sooner have the Final Girls all shut themselves in their respective rooms than Slasher A is on their phones, texting them videos they assume are from Karen, taunting them over “her” Machiavellian victory. The girls convene on video chat and agree: The video plan is a go. And so Tabby sets to work making her recordingproof edit of the video to sneak into the projection booth (a plan that includes convincing Chip to do said sneaking). The rest of the girls set to work, making sure that there will be a full house and that Karen will be “dead center.” If it wasn’t obvious from the moment Imogen told the rest of the girls the video even existed that this was going to be an awful idea, the inevitable appearance of Slasher A skulking behind the theater screen would be enough of a red flag. Danger zone, girls! Bad! Plan! Alas, they go through with it. The video, which starts as a tricksy “Vote for Karen for Spirit Queen!” campaign ad, turns into a short reel of a drunk Karen trying to make some unseen boy laugh by talking shit about her boyfriend then making it as though she’s going to take her top off for the phone owner’s personal-viewing pleasure. Tabitha’s edit ends there; Karen runs out of the theater in tears. Wes goes to investigate, but by then, the first Peele movie is starting, and the students are just clapping in anticipation. Frustratingly, none of the Final Girls are as remorseful of their actions as one would want them to be in this situation — and not just because it would be better if they were collectively kinder people. What I mean is this is a&nbsp; joint! This means that every failure in moral rectitude, no matter how minuscule, is ripe to be exploited as torture fodder by the   of the month. And because this particular&nbsp; &nbsp;joint is a&nbsp; , that’s the kind of thing that can get a girl dead. That said, there is one spark of regret among the five. In fact, Imogen actually ends up so wracked with guilt over the possibility that she’s turning into the teen bully her mom (RIP) always warned her against becoming that she agrees to meet Karen in the cemetery in the middle of the night to hash things out. (“It was kind of our thing,” she explains to a confused Tabitha on the next morning’s walk to school.) What this gets us is the missing piece of the flashback story that started the episode and the video, both of which were apparently a lot of buildup for nothing: Karen didn’t take her clothes off; Imogen didn’t kiss Greg. Better yet, Imogen was the one who&nbsp; &nbsp;Karen, having walked in on the pair after doubling back to get her sweater, which then allowed her to stop Karen and steal the phone before she could undo a single button. What it also gets us, with the combination of a video of a&nbsp; &nbsp;flirting with a gross jock’s camera and a creepy midnight conversation in a cemetery possibly orchestrated by (Slasher) A, is&nbsp; ’s next winking homage to&nbsp; &nbsp;Classic™ — fun! But more importantly, a useful red herring, as the skulking presence of ol’ leatherface a couple hundred feet from where Imogen eventually leaves Karen, upset and alone, is meant to make us believe that Karen’s about to meet her demise at the hands of Slasher A. Ali disappeared (and was, briefly, murdered) the night she was wearing that storied yellow top, remember! And to hear co-creator Lindsay Calhoon Bring tell it,&nbsp; &nbsp;is all about the question: “Will history always repeat itself?” In this case, the answer is no. There’s Karen in Principal Clanton’s office the next day, ready to own up to having defaced her own posters to get Imogen and Tabitha in trouble and to ask to drop out of the race for Spirit Queen, leaving Imogen to run unopposed. But also, in this case, the answer is yes! Because as it turns out (a) that was actually Kelly in Karen’s clothes, covering for her twin so Karen could stay home and spiral, and (b) Karen really&nbsp; &nbsp;about to meet her demise at the hands of Slasher A. Just not until everyone’s gathered at the Spirit Week dance later that night. Of course, planning to kill Karen at the Spirit Week dance and actually getting everyone there to see it happen are two entirely different propositions. But in this, Slasher A actually ends up getting some unwitting help, as eventually, Kelly gets Karen fired up enough about pulling a&nbsp; &nbsp;on Imogen as retribution that she agrees to go, and Tabitha gets the other Final Girls fired up enough about supporting Imogen in her bid to honor her mom’s Spirit Queen legacy that&nbsp; &nbsp;agree to go — and the awful Sheriff gets fired up enough about the prospect of Noa ratting on his sexual predation of minors that he agrees to makes a deal regarding her ankle monitor so&nbsp; &nbsp;can also go — and before you know it, the Spirit Week dance is on! And so it is that we get the first of what are sure to be many more big group entrances to arcane school events to come — i.e., one of the most iconic of&nbsp; &nbsp;staples. Faran’s in a flowing cream chiffon number. Noa’s found a flared, bright-red mini-number that’s both adorable and sexy all at once. Mouse is wearing a white baby tee under a breezy gown that’s literally a bright-blue summer sky dotted with puffy clouds. Tabby’s wearing the first shorts-suit in history to not look like a joke. Imogen’s in a gold-and-black velvet princess-waist gown that brings her ’80s granny aesthetic forward a whole decade. No notes! Great scene! And given how they’ve even arrived with a mission — to find Karen, apologize, and give her Imogen’s crown — if the episode ended there, everything would be perfect. Of course, the episode doesn’t end there. Where it ends instead is Imogen staring on in horror as, from up onstage where only she can see the hulking figure of Slasher A coming up behind Karen and her&nbsp; &nbsp;bucket up on the catwalk, her ex-BFF is pushed to her awful, bloody death. Then, in the only move more iconic to the&nbsp; &nbsp;world than the big dance entrance, five phones buzz, and five texts are read aloud simultaneously: “To thine own self be true. One bully down. Five more to go. Keep quiet about me or you’ll be next. - A” See you in mere moments for episode three. • Someone at the twins’ house party wrote “PARTY/GET DRUNK” in lipstick on the glass door of their parents’ curio cabinet. Normal teen behavior! • Look, I am sure that Tabitha has it in her to become a formidable director&nbsp; . But if not one single teen in that theater managed to flip to their phone’s video app in time to capture at least 90 percent of Tabby’s “unrecordable” edit, I’ll eat an entire bucket of popcorn swept up from the Orpheum’s floor. • It should be noted, I guess, that before Karen’s untimely demise, the Spirit Week dance does feature several other very sweet moments, including Noa and Shawn hooking up, Mouse and Ash flirting over a joint, and all five Final Girls and their respective dates dancing to David Bowie’s “Modern Love” in a big, joyful circle.

But actually, the British public bestowed this title. Before we go too far down this road, though, I should note that William’s purported love of pegging — which is to say, having a cis woman (probably, based on the forthcoming context clues) penetrate him anally with a strap-on — derives from pure speculation. Nothing here comes remotely close to being confirmed. Naturally, the Cambridges have not commented on nor acknowledged the hashtags, and again, I must emphasize that  . At the very least, though, I can tell you how we got here. Maybe you would like to know. In short because   ran a rare royal blind item this week. Like all the other blinds on DeuxMoi, it is unverified and quite possibly rubbish, but here’s what  : “This is so salacious I’m almost too shook to share with you (but will anyway). This British royal’s extramarital affair is an open secret in London and amongst the English artisto set, and is the talk of every party and newsdesk. At a recent media party, I was told the real reason for the affair was the royal’s love of pegging, which his wife is far too old fashioned to engage in. The wife doesn’t mind her and in fact prefers her husband getting his sexual needs met elsewhere, as long as things don’t become emotional, which was the case with the last woman.” Willy is getting the spotlight he wants. 🥳     Of course, there are a couple of royal husbands who could potentially fit this bill, but only one can be the “prince of pegging” (i.e., the hashtag that started trending with #princewilliamaffair after this blind went viral). People suspect William because of the flap with the Marchioness. So glad you asked. In 2019, the   reported on  , former model and current Marchioness of Cholmondeley, Rose Hanbury. Hanbury and her husband, Marquess of Cholmondeley ( ) David Rocksavage,   near Kate and William’s country estate Anmer Hall, and the   was saying that Kate had come to see Rose as her “rural rival” — and not just because, as   has pointed out, Rose looks almost exactly like her. According to the  , Kate wanted to excommunicate Rose from the turnip toffs over some “terrible” and “well-known” falling out. The   didn’t give reasons for the fight but other outlets did: Lainey Gossip&nbsp; &nbsp;that “rumours of an affair between Will and Rose have been simmering,” only “no one wanted” to name the possibility “out loud.” No one except British reporter named&nbsp;Giles Coren, I guess, who&nbsp; &nbsp;that “everyone knows about the affair.” Shortly after the   report was published, the   alleged that both parties were considering legal action over the supposed falsities, though none ever materialized. Still, this rumor had staying power and seems to be the reason some people think William is looking outside his marriage for partners who will peg him and that Kate is fine with that so long as she doesn’t wind up with another Marchioness of Cholmondeley situation on her hands. Again, the pegging rumor is itself baseless! We are plumbing the mind of an unnamed rando of questionable motivations! But looking at the  , we can identify a handful of possible candidates and eliminate one guy —   — who fails to meet the blind’s basic qualification of having a wife to care about his affairs. Below, our possibilities, ranked from most to least likely based on the speculation at hand: •  , for the reasons outlined above and also by process of elimination. Hard to imagine him having sex, but okay! •  , i.e., the queen’s youngest child and the current Earl of Wessex. Honestly, I don’t know much about this guy except what I learned from  . (Basically that Prince Eddie has a knack for non-iable business ventures and once followed Prince William around the University of St. Andrews with a camera for a documentary he, Eddie, was making.) Does he love pegging? Maybe! Couldn’t say! •  , who is famously married to Meghan Markle and just as famously stepped back from his official duties as a senior royal years ago. Mainly because of that decision, I doubt his personal life qualifies for “open secret in London” status (Harry and Meghan live in Montecito now) or that an alleged love of pegging would be “the talk of every party and newsdesk.” Then again,  , so maybe certain newsdesks are making up gossip about the internal goings-on of their marriage. •  , who is next in line for the throne. The main reason I don’t think this gossip refers to Charles is my genuine belief that if anyone were hypothetically going to peg him, he would insist it be  . A personal opinion based on my own subjective impression of their situation, of course, but then this man unwittingly went on the record as saying he would   if it meant they got to be together. And Camilla, for her part, doesn’t strike me as especially “old-fashioned.” She is said to be a good sport, generally speaking,&nbsp; &nbsp;by Charles as being “jolly good” and “down to earth.” Next! •  , who would be at the top of my list if he hadn’t  . Otherwise, he would arguably be a perfect candidate: His   are widely known, which would check the “open secret in London and amongst the English artisto set” box. I can also see the queen (who does usually present as “old-fashioned,”  ) turning a blind eye to this one so long as it did not engender serious feelings for another person. The only problem here is that Philip is dead. Unless? By submitting your email, you agree to our   and   and to receive email correspondence from us.

 After a year of raking the West Virginia senator over the coals, progressives and centrists alike complimented his new party-line deal.

 Link Copied House Democrats met  ‘s surprise deal with a bigger twist: unity behind it. The kumbaya moment-in-the-making is a welcome reversal for the downtrodden Democratic caucus that until two days ago was preparing for a summer recess with a fairly meager slate of accomplishments to tout. They’d encountered letdown after letdown on abortion, climate and a high-profile guns and policing package. Then Manchin’s unexpected agreement on a   single-handedly sparked a dramatic realignment of the caucus’ attitude. “It’s a really, really good deal,” said Rep.   (D-N.Y.), a frequent Manchin critic who this time called the West Virginia senator’s dealings a “pleasant surprise” and added: “It’s good to go into recess with a lot of momentum that people can go back to their districts and run on.” Manchin isn’t exactly the savior they anticipated. House Democrats across the spectrum have launched public grenades at him for nearly a year now as he blocked some of the party’s biggest priorities — from voting rights to expanding abortion access to multiple earlier versions of their sweeping domestic policy bill. Some preemptively blamed him for losing their majority this fall. But after months of feeling like Charlie Brown hoping Manchin’s Lucy won’t yank the football away, Speaker   and her caucus are now eager to take whatever Manchin and the rest of Senate Democrats can get through their 50-50 majority. If Democrats manage to pass the bill, it will give them a chance to trumpet action on several long-running campaign promises — on taxes, climate and drug pricing — in the months before a potentially brutal November election. “It’s not the full Build Back Better bill. But it’s a significant investment. … It’s a step forward. It would be a significant victory and it is the president’s agenda and the Democratic agenda,” said Congressional Progressive Caucus Chair Rep.   (D-Wash.), whose members quickly lined up behind the Senate deal. Jayapal’s embrace of the moderate senator comes just two weeks after she blasted Manchin as someone who “can’t close a deal” and said Democrats “can’t trust what he says” when it appeared he had scuttled the broader proposal. And she’s hardly the only one shifting course. Even House Democrats who had previously threatened to draw a hard line unless the package included relief for state and local taxes, known as SALT, are quickly signaling that they will fall in line. “We needed to see SALT in any bill that reopened the 2017 tax bill, that had other tax impacts on our middle-class constituents. This doesn’t do that. This is a bill on a completely different set of issues,” Rep.   (D-N.J.) said. “None of us said we were not going to vote for any bill coming out of the Senate unless it deals with SALT.” The boost to House Democrats’ collective self-esteem comes at a sorely needed time. Sharp disagreements within the caucus had just forced Pelosi to   that included the Democrats’ marquee bill to ban semi-automatic weapons. Even bipartisan legislation to address burn pit victims is mired in a procedural snafu over in the Senate. Unlike previous episodes of the extended Manchin drama, very few Democrats are digging in against their own this time around. And party leaders are urging their members to embrace the deal, despite it being a downsized version of what their party once dreamed up. “The moment we have a chance to do reconciliation, we have to take it,” Pelosi told members in a closed-door meeting Thursday morning, according to two people in the room. “We are very pleased with that.”

 Afterwards, Pelosi predicted to reporters that she would have the votes to pass the party-line deal on her side of the Capitol.  Even Senate Majority Leader   has privately made overtures to House members: The New York Democrat received a mostly rosy reception when he joined a call with progressives on Thursday, where he outlined the deal and thanked them for helping force the House to vote on the initial package. The burst of good news from the Senate may have unexpectedly helped another top Biden item this week:  . Few Democrats would publicly acknowledge that Manchin’s deal helped them sway liberal votes for a microchips bill that the left had initially scorned as a corporate giveaway. Elation over the surprise Manchin-Schumer agreement wasn’t the only factor, given the White House’s backdoor outreach to progressives in recent days. But in the end, zero Democrats opposed it — a turn that several aides privately speculated was, in part, due to the ability to stick it to a rankled   after the Senate minority leader vowed to sink the manufacturing bill if Democrats pursued their health care, energy and tax bill. Manchin announced his deal with Schumer hours after the semiconductor bill passed the Senate. It’s been more than eight months since the House passed their version of Biden’s sweeping domestic policy vision. That $1 trillion-plus bill, which drew comparisons to Great Depression-era social programs, no longer exists. Instead, as the nation’s inflation anxiety mounts, Manchin is handing House Democrats a bill that’s been re-engineered to reduce the deficit, while also reflecting their earlier goals of tax reform and climate. Another vote doesn’t seem far away. House Democrats are expected to return from their August recess in less than two weeks to take up the legislation after it passes the Senate, which Schumer has estimated could take 10 days. (Part of the Senate’s schedule will be determined by Democrats having all 50 of their members available to vote, a perpetual problem for the Covid-stricken caucus, as well as meeting certain requirements that govern evading the chamber’s filibuster rules.) House Democratic leaders have their own math considerations: They want to pass the bill before their already-slim margin for error shrinks in a matter of weeks thanks to a special election in Minnesota, where Republicans are expected to regain a seat as they replace the late Rep. Jim Hagedorn (R-Minn.).  After Hagedorn’s likely GOP successor is sworn in, Democrats will only be able to lose three of their own members on a party-line bill that will face unified Republican opposition. And Democrats’ numbers are expected to shrink further after a pair of special elections in New York on Aug. 23. “Realistically, what they have now I think is — I won’t say it’s take it or leave it — but it’s certainly if we’re not going to risk having further delay and losing that which we have, then I think we need to pass it,” Majority Leader   (D-Md.) said, predicting the House will pass the deal as is. And while several Democrats still lamented that many of their priorities were being cut out, they also accepted the legislative reality of a 50-50 Senate. In the words of Rep.   (D-Ariz.), letting Manchin largely dictate the scope of a deal was a “pattern [that] seems to have been tolerated for almost eight months.” “So this occurring — while surprising and lacking in other input — it’s not, by any stretch of the imagination, anything new,” Grijalva added. Or, as Rep.  (D-Va.) bluntly put it: “Joe Manchin’s for it. So it’s enough.” Link Copied  © 2022 POLITICO LLC 
			Welcome,		 The Chicago festival kicked off Thursday with heavy-metal titans, bluegrass pickers, and the first Zambian rapper to play the festival  2022 kicked off on Thursday in Chicago’s Grant Park with headliners  ,  , and  . Like the variety offered at the topline of the fest, the day featured an eclectic mix of music. From TikTok stars to rock royalty and the return of the Kidzapalooza stage for the first time in three years, there was something for every age group on Day 1. And if there was an underlying theme beyond appealing to a wide swath of fans, a handful of artists with famous kinfolk are taking center stage throughout the four-day festival. 
Speaking of scions, Inhaler, the Irish four-piece fronted by Elijah Hewson, a.k.a. Bono’s son, kicked off the parade of kids following in their family members’ footsteps during Lolla. Live, it was clear Hewson inherited his dad’s gift for singing, and he and the band — Josh Jenkinson (guitar), Robert Keating (bass) and Ryan McMahon (drums) — had an easygoing camaraderie with one another. “How many of you are up for a bit of a party?” Hewson asked before launching into “Who’s Your Money On? (Plastic House),” a melodic beat-driven tune that got the audience jumping along. That and other upbeat songs, including new single “These Are the Days,” landed stronger with the festival crowd than Inhaler’s more reflective material. 	 100 Gecs Steven Nunez @stevensjpeg for Rolling Stone* 	 Tove Lo Sacha Lecca for Rolling Stone* 	 Discord is something with which Maxo Kream is quite familiar. The Houston rapper has grappled with family conflict, criminality, and navigates his brother’s death on his latest aptly titled album  . While his adept storytelling is as heavy as the album’s title implies, his performance on Lolla’s Discord stage showcased resilience amid fiery a cappellas and confessionals (“Greener Knots”). He paid homage and dug in on personal loss, leading the exuberant crowd through R.I.P. chants for the brother he lost, and also highlighted other’s work, bringing out PGF Nuk for “Waddup.” 	 Lil Baby Steven Nunez for Rolling Stone* Atlanta rapper Lil Baby made his return to the Lollapalooza stage on Thursday following his first appearance in 2019 and he took his time to savor it, or at least not rush through things. A few verses were piped in before Lil Baby took the stage, occasionally backed by dancers. His relaxed entrance belied his commanding, yet laidback presence — whether he was onstage or dipped out for a break midset, the crowd clung and sung along to every word in a set that spanned his five-year rise from “All In” and “Southside” through new song “In a Minute.”

             Bernard Cribbins looks on after receiving the annual J M Barrie Award for a lifetime of unforgettable work for children on stage, film, television and record, at the Radio Theatre, Broadcasting House in London, on Nov. 13, 2014. Cribbins has died at age 93. LONDON — Bernard Cribbins, a beloved British entertainer whose seven-decade career ranged from the bawdy "Carry On" comedies to children's television and   has died. He was 93. Agent Gavin Barker Associates announced Cribbins' death on Thursday. "Bernard's contribution to British entertainment is without question," it said. "He was unique, typifying the best of his generation, and will be greatly missed by all who had the pleasure of knowing and working with him." A warm, avuncular character actor, Cribbins was a childhood presence for several generations of Britons. He played station porter Albert Perks in the 1970 movie classic "The Railway Children" and voiced all the characters in "The Wombles," a 1970s animated series about a family of burrowing creatures living under London's Wimbledon Common. Cribbins also was the voice of road-safety squirrel Tufty Fluffytail in a series of public information films, and held the record for the most appearances — more than 100 — on children's storytelling TV series "Jackanory." Born into a poor family in Oldham, northwest England, in 1928, Cribbins left school in his early teens and got his start as a stage manager and bit player in regional repertory theater. He moved on to West End productions before appearing in a dizzying range of British films, including 1960 comedy "Two-Way Stretch" alongside Peter Sellers; 1966 "Doctor Who" spinoff "Daleks' Invasion Earth 2150 AD"; the 1967 James Bond spoof "Casino Royale"; and one of Alfred Hitchcock's final thrillers, "Frenzy" in 1972. He appeared in several movies in the "Carry On" series, was a memorable guest star on classic sitcom   and had top 10 hits with comedy songs "Hole in the Ground" and "Right Said Fred." A younger generation knew Cribbins as Wilfred Mott, a companion to David Tennant's titular Doctor, when "Doctor Who" was revived in the early 21st century. He appeared in another BBC children's series, "Old Jack's Boat," between 2013 and 2015, and filmed scenes earlier this year for an upcoming "Doctor Who" 60th-anniversary special. "Doctor Who" showrunner Russell T. Davies remembered Cribbins as "a wonderful actor." "I'm so lucky to have known him ," Davies said. "Thanks for everything, my old soldier. A legend has left the world." Cribbins' wife of 66 years, Gill, died last year. Sponsor Message BEDMINSTER, N.J. — LIV Golf is just three tournaments in, but the Saudi-backed upstart league is already thinking big about its future. In an interview with CNBC, LIV Golf Investments President and COO Atul Khosla said the future of LIV Golf is teams and creating franchises that can one day be sold. The organization is holding an event this weekend, starting Friday, at former President Donald Trump's namesake golf club here. "We're building 12 teams with franchise values, just like any other sport that we fully expect down the road to have a valuation to be sold," he said. "All of those things will happen in golf that happen in every other sport." Khosla says the company came to the conclusion from their first two tournaments in London and Portland, Oregon, that fans love golf as a team sport. He says the team merchandise sales sold out the first day during the tournaments. "The team concept is really resonating with our fans," he said. The new golf league is financed by Saudi Arabia's Private Investment Fund. The kingdom's fund has set its sights on the sports sector as another investment piece in its portfolio and has invested a reported $2 billion into LIV Golf.   LIV is spending top dollar to lure golf pros from the PGA Tour, offering equity in the league, generous prizes and guaranteed money. So far, it has signed big name players like Phil Mickelson, Dustin Johnson and Bryson DeChambeau. They've also snagged top golf commentator David Feherty away from Golf Channel and reportedly had their sights on bringing on TNT's Charles Barkley. (Barkley told The New York Post that he decided to stay with Turner Sports and not join LIV,  .) "We do have a longer runway," Khosla said. "But our investor definitely wants to see returns at the end of the day." The Saudi support has created some controversy for LIV, however. Family members of those who perished in the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks are protesting the league. Fifteen of the 19 hijackers that day were from Saudi Arabia, and Osama Bin Laden, the attacks' mastermind, was born in the country. U.S. officials concluded that Saudi nationals helped fund the terrorist group al-Qaida, although investigations didn't find that Saudi officials were complicit in the attacks. Trump on Thursday defended hosting the event, falsely claiming that  The group 9/11 Justice protested near Trump's course, which is less than 50 miles of the Ground Zero site in lower Manhattan. "To see a former president pretending that he doesn't know what the Saudis did, or saying that he doesn't know about the 9/11 story, it's just the worst form. It's the worst feeling you can get," the group's president, Brett Eagleson, told CNBC. He was 15 when he lost his father when the Twin Towers collapsed after hijackers crashed airliners into them. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., sided with the protesters. "I support the 9/11 families' pursuit of justice and remain committed to holding Saudi Arabia accountable for its actions," he said in a statement Friday. Khosla also defended LIV. He said the league isn't the only one with ties to Saudi Arabia. "There are about 23 PGA Tour partners today that have ties to the multibillion-dollar business in Saudi Arabia. I'm not telling the PGA Tour to not have sponsors," he said. "It's an interconnected global economy so just because a bunch of golfers took a little bit of money, I just don't think you need to get all worked up," he added. Got a confidential news tip?

(1:43) BUDAPEST, Hungary --   has backed Haas driver   to replace him at Aston   when he retires at the end of this season.  on Thursday and has 10 races remaining before he leaves F1. The news means there is a vacant seat alongside   at Aston Martin next year, and speculation is rife over who will fill it. Vettel, who is close to the Schumacher family and grew up idolising Mick's father, Michael, said he had briefly talked to Aston Martin owner Lawrence Stroll about possible replacements. "Well obviously I spoke to Lawrence and told them that I am not going to continue," Vettel said. "We did have a very, very brief chat about what might be next. "I do have my opinion. I think very highly of Mick. I'm obviously not entirely objective because I am very close to him, but I do think he's a great driver. "He's a learner, he keeps learning when others sort of stall or stop making progress. So he does have a lot of qualities, but he is also very young still. "So I don't know. It's not my decision. If I am asked I will give my opinion, but in the end the team have to make that decision." Schumacher currently drives for Haas but is not contracted to the team beyond the end of this year. Haas team principal Guenther Steiner said Vettel's decision to leave Aston "doesn't change anything for us" and said he and team owner Gene Haas would make a decision by the Italian Grand Prix in September. "We will know by the end of the European season what we are doing, and then we will communicate it," Steiner said. "We need to start to speak to Gene about it and talk through the different scenarios of what we are going to do. "It has become standard to speak about this, but we will take our time." “It’s not a collab it’s theft,” Kelis wrote on Instagram.

By focusing on his canine best friend. At least, that’s the gambit behind director and co-writer Jared Stern’s reasonably fresh animated comedy “DC League of Super-Pets” (Warner Bros.). Introduced in previous DC Comics lore and dubbed Krypto (voice of Dwayne Johnson), the pooch — according to Stern’s screenplay, penned with John Whittington — has shown unwavering devotion to the Man of Steel (voice of John Krasinski) ever since he was a pup. But their close relationship is complicated by Superman’s romance with Lois Lane (voice of Olivia Wilde). More ominously, their welfare is endangered by the machinations of Lulu (voice of Kate McKinnon), a villainous guinea pig who has managed to acquire superpowers. To defeat her, Krypto turns to a band of similarly gifted recue animals led by Ace (voice of Kevin Hart), a scrappy hound whose gruff exterior hides a warm heart. As the ensemble battle evil, they learn such life lessons as the need to be themselves, the value of working together and the self-sacrificial nature of real love. While overcomplicated — no fewer than three different types of kryptonite are mentioned in the script and a host of Superman’s fellow characters from the DC stable put in brief appearances — their story is occasionally amusing and mostly unobjectionable. Yet not entirely so. Besides the predictable potty jokes, a reference to Superman and Lois’ habit of spending some of their nights together as well as several bleeped out — but easily guessed — swear words bar endorsement of the film for very young viewers. Teens, by contrast, will likely take these elements in stride. Whether they’ll be as susceptible as their juniors to the cuddly cuteness on which Stern sometimes relies, however, is another question. The film contains a vague reference to premarital sexual activity, censored vulgar language, a few scatological jokes and a single crass term.

Here are the key numbers compared to what Wall Street was expecting, per Refinitiv estimates: &nbsp; Apple did not provide formal guidance for the quarter. Analysts expected the company to give fourth-quarter guidance of $1.31 in earnings per share and nearly $90 billion in sales.&nbsp; "In terms of an outlook in the aggregate, we expect revenue to accelerate in the September quarter despite seeing some pockets of softness," Apple CEO Tim Cook told CNBC's Steve Kovach.&nbsp; Apple's revenue rose 2% during the quarter, compared to 36% growth during the same period last year and over 8% growth in the March quarter. Cook said the results were better than expected and CFO Luca Maestri said it was a "challenging operating environment."&nbsp; Chipmakers and other computer vendors have signaled that there is slowing demand for smartphones and PCs around the world as consumers grapple with recession fears and decades-high inflation.&nbsp;Apple's soft growth may suggest that the consumer electronics industry — including leaders like Apple — is headed for a period of slow or no growth.&nbsp; Cook told CNBC that the company is seeing inflation but will continue to make investments. &nbsp; "We do see inflation in our cost structure," Cook said. "We see it in things like logistics and wages and certain silicon components and we're still hiring, but we're doing it on a deliberate basis."&nbsp; Apple's iPhone sales exceeded Wall Street expectations, suggesting that demand for iPhone 13 models remains strong even in the second half of the product's annual release cycle. Apple typically releases new iPhones in September and sales fall as customers anticipate new models.&nbsp; Cook said Apple had success attracting Android customers to become iPhone owners during the quarter.&nbsp; "We had a record level of switchers and saw double digit growth for customers new to iPhone," Cook said.&nbsp; The Services business was the fastest growing segment for Apple during the quarter. It includes monthly subscriptions, payment fees, warranties, search licensing fees from Google, and revenue from the iPhone App Store.&nbsp; Services grew over 12% during the quarter, although that is a decline from the 17% growth it posted in the second quarter, and down from the 27% growth it reported during the same time period last year.&nbsp; Cook said Apple has 860 million current paid subscriptions, which includes anyone who subscribes to an app sold on the Apple App Store in addition to products such as Apple Music and iCloud. &nbsp; Mac sales were short of consensus expectations and fell over 10% on a year-over-year basis. Cook said this was due to supply constraints and the strong dollar.&nbsp; In April, Apple warned that parts shortages would hit revenue by between $4 billion and $8 billion, and Apple's website showed extended shipping times for many Mac models during the quarter. Cook said the ultimate hit came in under $4 billion.&nbsp; Apple also announced new MacBook Air models during June that did not start shipping to customers until July. MacBook Air is Apple's best-selling computer. &nbsp; Apple's iPad declined 2% annually, but beat soft Wall Street forecasts, as iPad tablets were one of the product lines analysts believed that Apple might prioritize away from in the face of a chip shortage. Cook said that the iPad decline was also driven by supply constraints and a strong dollar. &nbsp; Apple's other products category, which includes headphones like AirPods, Apple Watches, and HomePod speakers declined over 8% on an annual basis and missed Wall Street expectations.&nbsp; Apple's business in Greater China, which includes Taiwan and Hong Kong, declined 1% on an annual basis to $14.6 billion. Cook said that result was despite major Covid restrictions that hurt demand. &nbsp; Apple's gross margin exceeded the company's own forecast from April. Apple reported 43.26% in gross margin, over the 42% to 43% range the company suggested earlier this year. &nbsp; Apple said it spent over $28 billion on share buybacks and dividends during the quarter.&nbsp; Got a confidential news tip?

Andy Beshear said Friday.  CNN's Joe Johns, Amanda Watts, Amy Simonson, Angela Fritz, Caitlin Kaiser, Sara Smart, Sharif Paget, Amanda Musa, Claudia Dominguez, Michelle Watson, Caitlyn Kaiser and Jason Hanna contributed to this report.  Jeff Darlington breaks down how DK Metcalf's extension plays into the Seahawks' long-term plans. (1:17) RENTON, Wash. -- The   have signed star wide receiver   to a multiyear extension, the team announced Friday. The Seahawks did not announce terms of the new deal, but a source told ESPN's Adam Schefter on Thursday that it is a three-year, $72 million extension that includes $58.2 million in guarantees. The guaranteed total includes a $30 million signing bonus, the source said, the highest ever for a wide receiver. "This means a lot to me, for my future, my family's future, my future with the Seahawks," Metcalf said in a statement released by the team. "It just means a lot, and it's a blessing to get it done and behind me. I'm excited to go back to practice and rejoin the team fully." The deal brings a quick end to Metcalf's two-day "hold in" and locks up one of the top performers of the Seahawks' future. The 24-year-old Metcalf, who had one year and just under $4 million left on his rookie contract, is now signed through 2025. The $24 million new-money average of his extension makes Metcalf the Seahawks' highest-paid player, surpassing safety   at $17.5 million, and cements him as the new face of the franchise now that   and   are gone. Metcalf and   of the   are now tied for having the sixth-highest annual average salary among NFL receivers. The three-year length of the extension is shorter than the Seahawks typically prefer for big-money second contracts, and it puts Metcalf on track to become a free agent at age 28. It also came with a shorter wait than some of the Seahawks' recent megadeals that weren't finalized until well into training camp. Metcalf reported to camp on time Tuesday but didn't take part in the first two practices as his agent, Tory Dandy, and the Seahawks continued to negotiate. Coach Pete Carroll made it clear that his nonparticipation was contract-related and not due to Metcalf's surgically repaired foot. Metcalf's future in Seattle seemed somewhat uncertain earlier this offseason, after general manager John Schneider publicly expressed sticker shock at some of the megadeals that caused the receiver market to skyrocket. The Seahawks received calls from teams interested in Metcalf in the wake of those comments, but Seattle told suitors it wasn't interested in trading him, according to a source. Despite the trade speculation and the rising WR salaries, the Seahawks expressed confidence both publicly and behind the scenes that they'd get a deal done with Metcalf before the season. That was the case even after Metcalf's unsettled contract prompted the receiver to skip last month's mandatory minicamp with what the team deemed to be an unexcused absence. Carroll noted then that the Seahawks have a strong track record of extending players they want to keep long-term since he and Schneider arrived in 2010. "I'm not less optimistic, no," Carroll said in June, after Metcalf's minicamp no-show. "We've been through this for years. It's a challenging time. We've had so many high-profile guys that have gone through this process, and how's that worked out for us? We've figured it out in time. John is on it. He's as experienced as you can get at handling this stuff and DK's got great representation and DK is a heck of a kid. But there's no way of avoiding the first time of this, the first time of what it feels like and the experience of it and all of that. ... He's a remarkable person. He's a wonderful player. He has so much to offer the world and all, I just don't want him to miss this opportunity to where we can't figure it out. So we'll do everything we can." Metcalf has a combined 216 catches for 3,170 yards and 29 touchdowns over his first three seasons. He made his lone Pro Bowl in 2020 after breaking Steve Largent's single-season franchise record with 1,303 receiving yards. After suffering a career-threatening neck injury in college, Metcalf hasn't missed a game in his NFL career. He played most of last season with a broken bone in his foot that required surgery. Carroll said Wednesday that Metcalf passed his physical and is fine. The New York Yankees outfield is becoming more crowded by the day. After they acquired Andrew Benintendi via trade on Tuesday, five regular Yankee outfielders, including the injured Giancarlo Stanton, have a higher OPS than Joey Gallo. Gallo has been mired in a slump since joining New York at the trade deadline in 2021. Prior to that deal, Gallo had slashed .211/.336/.497 for his career. His defense was phenomenal and he was one of the league's most feared home run hitters with a tremendous walk rate. Since his arrival in the Bronx, Gallo is slashing .160/.293/.371. Good players don't just turn into bad players overnight, and Gallo has been a terrible hitter since joining the Yankees. There must be extraneous circumstances. The Yankees recognize this and have begun to bench Gallo ahead of the trade deadline. Their starting outfield now consists of Aaron Judge, Matt Carpenter and Aaron Hicks, it will soon include Benintendi. There's no place for Gallo on the Yankees roster but every front office around the league knows he's an ideal rebound candidate. That may be why the Yankees are asking for more than just salary relief. Gallo is a free agent after 2022, the Yankees will lose him even if they don't trade him. So between the Yankees setting their asking price too high, and the impending end of Gallo's $10.275 million contract, a high stakes game of chicken is at hand. Thus far both the San Diego Padres and Gallo's former team, the Texas Rangers, have shown interest in the 28-year-old. However, both of these teams have apparently shifted their focus to Juan Soto and, understandably, don't wish to give up a top-level prospect for such a high-risk, high-reward player. The Philadelphia Phillies meanwhile, are most certainly not involved in Soto trade talks. Being a division rival of the Washington Nationals, the asking price will be higher, and the Phillies have no where to put him. Phillies President Dave Dombrowski's phone line should be open 24/7 to discuss players like Gallo. And having already crossed the first luxury tax threshold, money should not be an issue for the Phillies. If they are able to out wait the Yankees high price tag, then   for the next several months at Citizens Bank Park.
